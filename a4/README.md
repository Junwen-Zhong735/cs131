some entries contain lines that contain only whitespaces which occurs before lines with "Stars:". lines with the pattern "Stars:" (no ") typically have a line above them that only has the character "|". this makes the lack of a | on the line before the line that contains Stars: an inconsistancy. A file that is expecting a | in the line before "Stars:" would create an incorrect output or even possibly break while trying to read movies.csv due to this inconsistency.
